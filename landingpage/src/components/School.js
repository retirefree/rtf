                <h2 className="mb-4">1.	What is an annuity?</h2>
  	        	      <p>Every year, Americans buy over 200 billion dollars of annuities to secure their financial future. An annuity is an insurance contract that allows individuals to save for their retirement. There are many types of annuities which provide a range of benefits and are designed for a range of risk profiles. Key annuity benefits include:</p>
						  			<ul>
                      <li>Providing guaranteed income payments</li>
                      <li>Ensuring you don’t run out of money in retirement</li>
                      <li>Providing tax deferred growth</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Annuities provide an opportunity to accumulate savings and provide guaranteed income like a pension. There are four key types of annuities:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Fixed Annuities: Fixed Annuities are the simplest type of annuities designed to help Americans grow their savings in a tax-deferred manner. The simplest form of Fixed Annuities is called Multi-Year Guaranteed Annuity (MYGA) which provides guaranteed interest rates and tax deferred growth to help save for retirement. Guaranteed rates offered by Fixed Annuities are typically higher than those offered by Certificates of Deposits (CDs) or other short term guaranteed investments - which makes fixed annuities a common part of a retirement plan</li>
                      <li>Income Annuities: Income annuities converts your retirement savings into guaranteed income for life to make sure you don’t run out of money in retirement. Just like you insure your car, you can insure your retirement income by buying an income annuity to generate guaranteed income for life. The simplest form of income annuity is known as the Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA). This type of annuity is ideal for people retiring soon or for those already in retirement. For this annuity, you pay a given amount of money upfront and receives an income stream that lasts as long as you live. It is common for the annuity to cover both you and your spouse’s lives, where the income payments continues as long as either you or your spouse is alive</li>
                      <li>Indexed Annuities: Indexed annuities provide the ability to invest in common stock indices while protecting the downside risk. At retirement, these annuities provide a range of withdrawal benefits including the ability to withdraw the money in a lump sum or convert to a guaranteed monthly income for life</li>
                      <li>Variable Annuities: Variable annuities allow individuals to invest in a wide range of investment options, including a range of mutual funds, while providing multiple guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed accumulation, income and living benefits</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>As described above, there are many types of annuities in the market, some of which have complicated features and guarantees. At Easy Annuities, we recommend focusing on simple fixed annuities and income annuities to protect your retirement. These annuities can be purchased at different points in time including years before retirement, near- or during-retirement or over time - and provide guaranteed income in retirement to simplify your retirement spending and ensure peace of mind that you will not outlive your savings.</p>
                    <p>We believe that Americans can benefit from learning more about annuities and better utilizing annuities. We are working hard to simplify the annuity buying experience and support Americans in securing financial freedom during retirement.</p>

                <h2 className="mb-4">2.	Are annuities right for you? </h2>
  	        	      <p>Americans are living longer than ever. If you knew exactly how long you’d live and what the economy was going to do, retirement planning would be a breeze. But since you don’t, fixed annuities and income annuities can help ensure a retirement strategy and income that lasts as long as you do, which is likely to be a very long time.</p>
						  			<p>Annuities are financial products designed to secure financial freedom during retirement. An annuity is a form of insurance that provides low-risk, tax-deferred growth and protects the risk that you will outlive your money in retirement. When you purchase an annuity, you pay an insurance company to invest your money and in turn, the insurer guarantees you income for the rest of your life. When considering an annuity purchase, you should consider all sources of income and spending for the retirement years. Annuities may be ideal for you if:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>You have retirement savings and would like to grow your savings in a low-risk, tax-deferred manner</li>
                      <li>Your expected pension benefits and social security income are not sufficient to cover your monthly expenses</li>
                      <li>You lead a healthy lifestyle and hope to live a long life during retirement</li>
                      <li>You are seeking higher amount of guaranteed income during retirement</li>
                      <li>You would like guaranteed income for as long as you or your spouse live</li>
                      <li>Your savings are protected from the market and the income you’ll get is pre-determined</li>
                      <li>You have sufficient liquid financial assets to handle any unexpected expenses</li>
                      <li>You can plan your riskier investments more easily given your guaranteed income is secure</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Figuring out how long your retirement savings need to last is difficult. An annuity provides guaranteed lifetime income that reduces the likelihood that you’ll run out of money in retirement. Income from an annuity is predictable, steady, and cannot be outlived. Insurance is typically thought of as something you buy to protect you and your family from unfortunate events. The annuity offers a more pleasant kind of protection - namely, longevity insurance - meaning it protects you from outliving your savings. The longer you live, the more financial value the immediate annuity provides. And, by selecting the refund-at-death option, you can make sure that all of your savings will be passed onto your beneficiaries if you pass away prematurely.</p> 
                    <p>Immediate annuities are like paychecks rather than savings accounts, so the money you receive each month is fixed. Buying an immediate annuity with your pre-tax or post-tax retirement savings has a number of benefits, but also some drawbacks. While annuities provide specific guarantees that are unavailable in other financial products, they do offer limited liquidity and often include surrender charges. Typical annuities allow for 10% of the investment amount to be withdrawn without any penalties. However, the customer may have to pay a surrender charge on further withdrawals if they want to withdraw additional money before the annuity term is over. This can be a downside at times, as you don’t have withdrawal control over your savings. However, most insurance companies offer the option to receive the next few months of payments in advance, which can be useful in emergency situations. This benefit goes by many names: commutations, withdrawal benefits, or payment acceleration. Each insurance company has different rules as to how many months of payments you can receive at once, and how many times you can utilize the benefit.</p>
                    <p>While annuities are primarily insurance products, the value they offer can be compared to low-risk fixed income investments, such as an investment grade bond fund. As you approach retirement and no longer want to take sizable equity market risks, you’ll likely move some of your assets into safe but low returning bond funds. Moving some of those assets instead into a high-rated immediate annuity has the added benefit of providing you with a pre-determined lifetime income stream.</p>

                  <h2 className="mb-4">3.	Annuity purchase FAQs</h2>
  	        	      <ul><li><b>What is retirement income?</b></li></ul>
                    <p>Retirement income is the “salary” you receive once retired. The traditional sources of retirement income are social security and pensions, which are guaranteed to last for life. Annuities provide supplemental guaranteed retirement income. In addition, you can generate retirement income by withdrawing assets you accumulated over time (think 401(k), brokerage and savings accounts)</p>
                     
						  			<ul><li><b>Why do I need lifelong retirement income?</b></li></ul>
                    <p>The average American is living longer, which means that your savings have to last longer too. At the same time, the decline of defined benefits have made it harder to be financially prepared for retirement. Preparing for retirement with just savings exposes you to market risk and volatility. Guaranteed retirement income — like annuities — mitigates these risks</p>
					          
                    <ul><li><b>How can I generate retirement income?</b></li></ul>
                    <p>As long as you pay taxes, you are already generating retirement income in the form of Social Security. For some people, your employer may provide a pension as well. However, most people will need to generate retirement income by using their savings</p>

                    <ul><li><b>Why is it important to have sufficient retirement income?</b></li></ul>
                    <p>Unless you are saved a very significant amount of wealth, you risk running out of money in retirement for many reasons, such as you wound up living longer than you expected or markets didn’t do as well as you expected. Retirement income, on the other hand, comes in the form of Social Security, pensions, and annuities, all of which are not dependent on the market and are guaranteed to last as long as you do</p>

                    <ul><li><b>Do I need supplemental retirement income?</b></li></ul>
                    <p>You can use an annuity to supplement your other sources of retirement income by providing payments that cannot be outlived. These annuity payments can help cover expected living expenses. Calculating the "gap" between available retirement income (social security, pension and savings) and your essential living expenses (housing, insurance, etc.) can help determine the value that an annuity can provide – and can also help you determine how much you will need in payouts from your annuity</p>

                    <ul><li><b>What is an annuity?</b></li></ul>
                    <p>An annuity is a form of insurance that provides low-risk, tax-deferred growth and protects the risk that you will outlive your money in retirement. When you purchase an annuity you pay an insurance company, who invests your money, and promises to pay you a fixed and guaranteed amount of income starting on a future predetermined date and continuing for the rest of your life.</p>

                    <ul><li><b>What is a fixed annuity?</b></li></ul>
                    <p>A fixed annuity, also known as a multi-year guaranteed annuity (MYGA), provides a guaranteed rate of return for a predetermined period of time. It is most similar to a Certificate of Deposit (CD) that is offered by a bank or other-FDIC insured institution. When compared to CDs, fixed annuities offer higher guaranteed crediting rates over longer time horizons (3-10 years), tax-deferred growth, the ability to annuitize upon maturity, and liquidity via penalty-free partial withdrawals for those 59½ or over</p>

                    <ul><li><b>What is an income annuity?</b></li></ul>
                    <p>An immediate annuity, a.k.a. single premium immediate annuity or SPIA for short, is the simplest annuity product on the market. It’s purchased by people near- or in-retirement. For a given amount of money paid upfront today, you receive a set amount of monthly income starting within one year that lasts as long as you live</p>

                    <ul><li><b>Is now a bad time to buy an annuity?</b></li></ul>
                    <p>Just because we're in a period of low interest rates doesn’t mean it’s a bad time to buy an income annuity. In fact, if an annuity fits in with your overall investment strategy then you should go ahead regardless of what is happening with interest rates. This is because while you waited for interest rates to go up - which may or may not happen - you would be spending down more of your principal. This is especially true in years when your living expenses exceeded the interest, dividends and capital gains you were earning.</p>

                    <ul><li><b>Why does the insurance company need my financial information?</b></li></ul>
                    <p>Insurance companies collect financial information, such as your income, expenses, assets, and net worth, from those interested in purchasing annuities. They use this information to ensure that an annuity makes financial sense for someone. Specifically, since it is illiquid, the insurers want to see that individuals have enough liquid assets outside of those being used to fund the annuity</p>
                    
                    <ul><li><b>Where do insurance companies invest my money?</b></li></ul>
                    <p>Your money is invested conservatively by the insurance companies in line with their General Accounts investments, which are largely invested in fixed income investments as well as in some equities. Importantly, they take on all of the investment risk. So if the markets underperform, it’s on them. Not you</p>

                    <ul><li><b>What are surrender charges?</b></li></ul>
                    <p>Annuities offer limited liquidity and often include surrender charges. Typical annuities allow for 10% of the investment amount to be withdrawn without any penalties. However, the customer may have to pay a surrender charge on further withdrawals if they want to withdraw additional money before the annuity term is over. This can be a downside at times, as you don’t have withdrawal control over your savings. However, most insurance companies offer the option to receive the next few months of payments in advance, which can be useful in emergency situations. This benefit goes by many names: commutations, withdrawal benefits, or payment acceleration. Each insurance company has different rules as to how many months of payments you can receive at once, and how many times you can utilize the benefit.</p>
